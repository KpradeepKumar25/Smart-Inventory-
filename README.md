## üìä Calculation Logic

**Chicken Part Mapping:**
- 1 chicken = 2 legs (250g each) + 2 wings (250g each) + 1 flesh (1kg) = 2kg

**Order Calculation Steps:**

Given an order for:
- **X** legs
- **Y** wings
- **Z** flesh portions

1. **Chickens needed for legs:**  
   `ceil(X / 2)`

2. **Chickens needed for wings:**  
   `ceil(Y / 2)`

3. **Chickens needed for flesh:**  
   `Z`

4. **Minimum chickens required:**  
   `max(ceil(X / 2), ceil(Y / 2), Z)`

5. **Order weight:**  
   `(X * 250) + (Y * 250) + (Z * 1000)` (in grams)

6. **Remaining inventory calculation:**  
   - Legs left: `min_chickens * 2 - X`
   - Wings left: `min_chickens * 2 - Y`
   - Flesh left: `min_chickens - Z`

7. **Remaining inventory weight:**  
   `(legs_left * 250) + (wings_left * 250) + (flesh_left * 1000)`
